🎮 Game Analytics - Player Behavior & Engagement

📌 Overview
This project analyzes user engagement in an online game, identifying trends in player activity and monetization.

🎯 Goals
✔ Identify the most engaging game activities.  
✔ Analyze player demographics (age, language).  
✔ Assess monetization strategies (paying users, ARPPU, revenue by game).  
✔ Study user retention metrics (cohort analysis, DAU, WAU).  

📈 Key Findings:
- Battle Pass Challenges drive the highest engagement among all activities.
- Average player age: 28 years, with most players between 20-35 years old.
- Game 3 generates 99% of total revenue, while Game 1 & 2 need better monetization strategies.
- DAU/WAU ratio > 50%, indicating strong daily retention.

🔍 Additional Insights:
- 60% of players churn within the first 3 months, emphasizing the need for improved retention strategies.
- Young players (10-19 years old) spend the most time in-game but convert to paying users at a lower rate compared to the 25-35 age group.
- Players using older devices show lower engagement and monetization.

🚀 Recommendations:
✔ Introduce loyalty mechanics, such as daily login rewards and engagement-based bonuses.  
✔ Optimize monetization for younger players through limited-time offers and targeted promotions.  
✔ Enhance in-game retention strategies, including seasonal challenges and social-driven events.
